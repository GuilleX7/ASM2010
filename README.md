# ASM2010

ASM2010 is the core of the WASM2010 project. It comprises an assembler and an emulator for the CS instruction set architecture, which are bundled in a single native library. The library supports parsing assembly for CS2010 and CS3, as well as emulating them.

The project is written in standard C99, and can be compiled for many platforms using different compilers and build systems. We provide out-of-the-box support for the CMake build system, and we plan to add suport for Meson too (see https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/11862).

## Documentation

This has been part of my Computer Engineering degree final project. The official documentation for this project is located in the WASM2010 repository (at the ['docs' folder](https://github.com/GuilleX7/WASM2010/tree/master/docs)).
